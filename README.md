# CreativityMarket
Java Spring App.
It is a tool designed for artists and creators who are looking for new professional opportunities. The platform allows you to set up an account, upload a sample portfolio and create orders for specific services. Creators can specify the price range, type of preferred cooperation and availability, which allows for the appropriate adjustment of orders to their needs and capabilities.
The application also provides the option of searching for orders by field, price range and execution time. Creators also have the ability to manage orders, including accepting or rejecting proposals from employers and submitting their own proposals for the implementation of orders, removing and editing them. Additionally, creators can add employers to their favorites list to track their job openings.
In turn, employers can set up an account, add job offers, taking into account the subject, field, price range and execution time. The platform also allows you to search for creators in the appropriate field, manage orders and add creators to the list of favorites, which makes it easier to track the updates of their portfolio, and the availability of proposals for the execution of orders.
CreativityMarket does not support payments, but it allows employers and artists to contact them, which allows them to negotiate the remuneration of the commission. In this way, employers and creators can set the terms of cooperation at the appropriate level.
The choice of Java language, Java Spring framework and Thymeleaf templating engine is appropriate for this project as it provides optimal support for web application development and dependency management. The Spring framework also provides many tools for configuration management, security, and HTTP query handling, which is one of the key features when implementing this project. Thymeleaf's template engine enables efficient and intuitive creation of attractive user interfaces, which is important for an application aimed at artists and creators.
The layered architecture allows you to separate the business logic from the presentation and data access layers, which makes it easier to test and maintain the application. Thanks to this, it is possible to easily extend and update the application without having to make changes to the entire code.
Choosing the H2 database with the Liquidbase extension allows for efficient database management and enables automatic updating of the database schema in case of changes in the application code. H2 is a lightweight database that is transparent to use, and Liquidbase eliminates the need for manual scripting.
